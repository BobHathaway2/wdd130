      <h3>Lazy H Ranch</h3>
      <p>
        Howdy all y’all!

        It’s wonderful to have you come for a visit to the Lazy H Ranch website! It’d be even more wonderful if you came to visit in person! There's some beautiful sunsets right now, but hurry before the snow gets too deep!
        There’s lots been done and lots to do out here and I just wanted you to see some what’s where with regards to construction! More exciting than construction is the fun animal life that surrounds us in these high plains of Wyoming, so I thought I’d share some of the camera shots I have. There’s tons of jackrabbits and antelope and I’m guessing someday one of those elusive jackalopes is going to wander by for a howdy-do. Rounding out the mix are ground squirrels, prairie dogs, hawks, eagles, owls, badgers, coyotes, foxes, and the occasional bobcat are captured more on the security cameras out here than through my personal peepers. 
        
        Anywho, let me know if there’s something else you want to see or think should be posted here, and I’ll do what I can.

      <h3>Construction</h3>
      <p>
        Construction

        Still no cabin built, but the greenhouse was dried in just as the snow started to fly last year. The travel trailer is still out here and is my home-away-from-home. I also built a quick 7’x7’ outhouse that encloses a portable toilet and a composting toilet, one for short legs and one for longer legs. I mainly threw the building around it because one of your cousins/nephews wasn’t thrilled about a tarp surrounding the facilities on only three sides.

        Lately, I’ve been excavating for an underground storage shed. The excavation for the foundation is on hold while I finish a 150’ drainage ditch that’s up to 3’ deep so that if we do have a water incident, the water has somewhere to go. Digging that ditch with a pick and shovel has been arduous! (Did I mention there’s lots to do out here?) That shed will get the water pressure tank, 600 gallons of water storage, solar controllers, batteries and inverters. It’ll be good to have all that in so when people come out we’ll have running water and I don’t have to run the generators to keep charging the 500 devices they bring with them! Speaking of water, I had the well water tested again this year and it’s still as yummy as ever, maybe a little hard, but I don’t even think it’s as hard as my Tooele Water. So blessed that it ended up being half the depth (and cost) we were expecting and the water is usable! 

        That’s about it for what’s new, not a lot of progress, but as my dad used to tell me, “I may be old, but I’m slow!” (I’m not sure… Did I mention, there’s lots to do out here? I’d love to have you visit so I can put you to work. I mean, show you around the place!)

        Wildlife on the Ranch

        Some of you know, we have a prairie dog town here on the ranch. It’s in the southeast corner of the property, so it’s about a 600 yards from the homestead. They’re cute little fellers, but a little shy. It’s fun to stand off about 100 yards away and watch them come up and chatter.

        There’s a resident buck antelope that seems to spend most of his time on the property. He’s not quite as shy and will let me get within about 50 yards of him before he starts to wander away. If I turn around and start to move away from him, he’ll usually go back to whatever he was doing. He seems to have a couple of favorite bedding spots in the sagebrush around the homestead. The antelope are currently in the rut, and he’s had a few does close around and even got in a heated and vigorous battle with another just a couple of days ago (3rd of October 2022,) but I think he won and is still hanging around running off other challengers. It’s been fun to watch.

        Rabbits! They breed like… well, rabbits! There’s so many here, jacks and cottontails. There was a fluffle of baby cottontails running every which way early this spring. They were so cute and looks so cuddly! They are nervous Nellie’s though, it was hard to get a picture because usually before I could get my phone out to get a picture, they had high-tailed it (literally) out of site. Their parents are not as skittish, I’ve been able to get within just a few feet, as few as 5 feet, of adult cottontails and jackrabbits. One of the large jackrabbits seemed to be extremely curious of what I was doing when I was cutting some wood. I worried there was something wrong with him for a few minutes, because he just ran up, stood about 10 feet away and watched me for quite a while, even though I was running a saw. There’s one rabbit down in the meadow below the homestead that Uncle Rob and I believe is a giant rabbit. It looks so big! It’s about 100 yards away and comes out into the meadow just before dark, but it looks massive! No antlers though, so not a buck jackalope, could be a doe though! 

        Other than chipmunks, that are also plentiful, the rest of the critters only visit occasionally. The security cameras have caught a bobcat, a fox, skunks, badgers, either a large house cat or a small cougar, and a trespassing sheepherder.
