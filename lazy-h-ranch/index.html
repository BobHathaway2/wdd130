                    Howdy all y’all! It’s wonderful to have you come for a visit to the Lazy H Ranch website! It’d be even more wonderful if you came to visit in person! There's some beautiful sunsets right now, but hurry before the snow gets too deep! There’s lots been done and lots to do out here and I just wanted you to see some what’s where with regards to construction! More exciting than construction is the fun animal life that surrounds us in these high plains of Wyoming, so I thought I’d share some of the camera shots I have.

                    There are tons of jackrabbits and antelope and I’m guessing someday one of those elusive jackalopes is going to wander by for a howdy-do. Rounding out the mix are ground squirrels, prairie dogs, hawks, eagles, owls, badgers, coyotes, foxes, and the occasional bobcat are captured more on the security cameras out here than through my personal peepers. Anywho, let me know if there’s something else you want to see or think should be posted here, and I’ll do what I can.
