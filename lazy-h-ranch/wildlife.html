                    There’s a resident buck antelope that seems to spend most of his time on the property. He’s not very shy and will let me get within about 50 yards of him before he starts to wander away. If I turn around and start to move away from him, he’ll usually go back to whatever he was doing. He seems to have a couple of favorite bedding spots in the sagebrush around the homestead. The antelope are currently in the rut, and he’s had a few does close around and even got in a heated and vigorous battle with another buck just a couple of days ago (3rd of October 2022.) I think he won and is still hanging around running off other challengers as they try get close to the does that are close by. It’s been fun to watch.

                    Rabbits! They must breed like… well, rabbits! There are so many here, jacks and cottontails. There was a fluffle of baby cottontails running every which way early this spring. They were so cute and look so cuddly! They are nervous Nellie’s though. It was hard to get a picture because usually before I could get my phone out to get a picture, they had high-tailed it (literally) out of sight. Their parents are not as skittish, I’ve been able to get within just a few feet, as few as 5 feet, of adult cottontails and jackrabbits. One of the large jackrabbits seemed to be extremely curious of what I was doing when I was cutting some wood. I worried there was something wrong with him for a few minutes, because he just ran up, stood about 10 feet away and watched me for quite a while, even though I was running a saw. But, after I stopped, asked if he was okay and walked toward him, he scampered off. There’s one rabbit down in the meadow below the homestead that Uncle Rob and I believe is a giant rabbit. It looks so big! It’s about 100 yards away and comes out into the meadow just before dark, but it looks massive! No antlers, so not a buck jackalope, could be a doe though! Other than chipmunks, that are also plentiful, the rest of the critters only visit occasionally. The security cameras have caught a bobcat, a fox, skunks, badgers, either a large house cat or a small cougar, and a trespassing sheepherder. You just never know what's going to turn up on the cameras!

                    Some of you know, we have a prairie dog town here on the ranch. It’s in the southeast corner of the property, so it’s about a 600 yards from the homestead. They’re cute little fellers, but a little shy. It’s fun to stand off about 100 yards away and watch them come up and chatter. Come any closer and they are down into their burrows and won't come up until you leave. This picture was taken over 100 yards away and although difficult, I can see at about eight of the little cuties. How many can you see?
